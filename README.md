# üåç Shared locales between Thorium products

We're gradually moving to shared locales between Thorium products, which includes:

* [Thorium Desktop](https://github.com/edrlab/thorium-reader)
* [Thorium Web](https://github.com/edrlab/thorium-web)
* and Thorium Mobile

This repository is meant to host these locales, made available to our translators [through Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/thorium-reader).
