# Processes

## Adding, removing, and updating strings

TBD

## Reviewing

It is required every change impacting locale strings is made through a pull request, and that it is reviewed by at least one maintainer of each projects involved.

## Contextualizing

It is expected that following a merge, translators will contextualize the new and updated strings in Weblate, if needed. They can explain what the string is used for, and provide examples of how it is used, as well as adding screenshots if relevant.
